A good friend of mine came up with this idea: "what if we had a calculator with tabs?". After a night of being stuck at the airport, I went ahead and started hacking away at a calculator that had tabs and came up with [a working prototype of the idea](http://calculatorific.herokuapp.com/).

It got me thinking -- what if we could reinvent the modern calculator UI? Calculators are long due a face lift. Who uses those M+, MR, M- keys, anyway? Or know what they mean?
